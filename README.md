Stop Sign Violation Detection System
Project Overview
This project was developed as part of a Seminar Course during my B.Sc. studies in Information Systems at The Max Stern Yezreel Valley College.

The system utilizes Computer Vision and Deep Learning techniques to identify stop signs and detect whether a vehicle has performed a full stop as required by law. This project aims to enhance road safety by providing an automated tool for monitoring traffic violations.

Features
Object Detection: Identifies stop signs in real-time or from video files.

Violation Logic: Analyzes vehicle movement to determine if a full stop occurred before the sign.

Data Driven: Processed using Python and specialized Computer Vision libraries.

Dataset and Videos
Since the video files used for this project are large, they are not hosted directly on GitHub. You can access the raw footage and the test datasets through the following link:

Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and Deep Learning frameworks

Platform: Google Colab

How to Run
Clone this repository.

Mount your Google Drive in Colab to access the video data.
